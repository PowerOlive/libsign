libsign
=======

This project targets to provide a generic signing framework. This framework
separates the signing request and signing process and correspondingly forms
the so-called signlet and signaturelet.

Each signaturelet only concerns about the details about how to construct the
layout of a signature format, and signlet only cares how to construct the
signing request.

selsign
-------

This signlet provides the capability of signing the file with SELoader PKCS#7
signature.

Here is the signing example:

$ selsign <file>

By default, the generated signature file is suffixed by ".p7a".

To dump the content of signature, run:
$ openssl pkcs7 -in <file.p7a> -print -text -noout
