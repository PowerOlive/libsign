libsign
=======

This project targets to provide a generic signing framework. This framework
separates the signing request and signing process and correspondingly forms
the so-called signlet and signaturelet.

Each signaturelet only concerns about the details about how to construct the
layout of a signature format, and signlet only cares how to construct the
signing request.

selsign
-------

This signlet provides the capability of signing the file with SELoader PKCS#7
signature.

Here is the signing example:

$ selsign <file>

By default, the generated signature file is suffixed by ".p7b".

How to verify the signature
---------------------------

Currently there is no easier way to recognize whether an signed file succeeds
the signature check or not.

To dump the content of signature, run:
$ openssl pkcs7 -in <file.p7b> -inform DER -print -text -noout | less

Find out the section "d.data", which is the SELoader signature. The last
20-byte is the SHA-256 digest value. Run sha256sum <file> and compare the
result with the SHA-256 digest value to know the consistency between them.
